    "# Basic Python\n",
    "## Sequence, Selection, and Iteration\n",
    "That is, we want to have facility with both direct manipulation of\n",
    "code as well as high-level description of programs. A nice model for thinking about (imperative) programming is called Sequence-Selection-Iteration. It refers to:\n",
    "1. **Sequence:** Perforning operations one at a time in a specific order.\n",
    "2. **Selection:** Using conditional statements such as if to select which orperations to execute.\n",
    "3. **Iteration:** Repeating some operations using loops or recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions and Evaluation\n",
    "**Expressions** get **evaluated** and produce a **value**.\n",
    "Parentheses and the order of operations determine the order that\n",
    "the functions are evaluated. Recall that in programming the order of operations is also called **operator precedence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables, Types and State\n",
    "It often happens that you compute something and want to keep it until later when you will use it. We often refer to stored information as **state**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We store information in **variables**. In Python, a variable is created by an assignment statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The equals sign is doing something (**assignment**) rather than describing something (equality). The right side of = is an expression that gets evaluated first. Only later does the assignment happen. If the left side of the assignment is a variable name that already exist, it is overwritten. If it doesn’t already exist, it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are just names. Every name is associated with some piece of\n",
    "data, called an object. The name is a string of characters and it is mapped to an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every object has a **type**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between a variable and the object it represents can get lost in our common speech because the variable is usually acting as the name of the object. There are some times when it’s useful to be clear about the difference, in particular when copying objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should think of an object as having three things: **an identity, a type, and a value**. Its identity cannot change. It can be used to see if two objects are actually the same object with the is keyword. For example, consider the following code."
