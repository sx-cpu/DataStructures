    "# **Chapter 2:** Basic Python\n",
    "## 2.1 Sequence, Selection, and Iteration\n",
    "That is, we want to have facility with both direct manipulation of\n",
    "code as well as high-level description of programs. A nice model for thinking about (imperative) programming is called Sequence-Selection-Iteration. It refers to:\n",
    "1. **Sequence:** Perforning operations one at a time in a specific order.\n",
    "2. **Selection:** Using conditional statements such as if to select which orperations to execute.\n",
    "3. **Iteration:** Repeating some operations using loops or recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Expressions and Evaluation\n",
    "**Expressions** get **evaluated** and produce a **value**.\n",
    "Parentheses and the order of operations determine the order that\n",
    "the functions are evaluated. Recall that in programming the order of operations is also called **operator precedence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Variables, Types and State\n",
    "It often happens that you compute something and want to keep it until later when you will use it. We often refer to stored information as **state**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We store information in **variables**. In Python, a variable is created by an assignment statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The equals sign is doing something (**assignment**) rather than describing something (equality). The right side of = is an expression that gets evaluated first. Only later does the assignment happen. If the left side of the assignment is a variable name that already exist, it is overwritten. If it doesn’t already exist, it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are just names. Every name is associated with some piece of\n",
    "data, called an object. The name is a string of characters and it is mapped to an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every object has a **type**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between a variable and the object it represents can get lost in our common speech because the variable is usually acting as the name of the object. There are some times when it’s useful to be clear about the difference, in particular when copying objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should think of an object as having three things: **an identity, a type, and a value**. Its identity cannot change. It can be used to see if two objects are actually the same object with the is keyword. For example, consider the following code."

    "\n",

    "type of object. If the value can be changed, we say that the object is **mutable**. If it cannot be changed, we say that the object is **immutable**. For example, strings are immutable. If you want to change a string, for example, by converting it to lowercase, then you will be creating a new string.\n",

    "## 2.8 Modules and Imports\n",
    "As we start to write more complex programs, it starts to make sense to break up the code across several files. A single .py file is called a module. You can import one module into another using the import keyword. The name of a module, by default, is the name of the file (without the .py extension).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the import (usually) results in the module being executed, it’s good practice to change the behavior of a script depending on whether it is being run directly, or being run as part of an import. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you run the module directly (i.e. as a script), then the `__name__ `variable is automatically set to main . If the module is being imported, the `__name__` defaults to the module name.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    print('This program is being run by itself')\n",
    "```\n",
    "One caveat is that modules are only executed the first time they are\n",

    "be executed once. \n",
